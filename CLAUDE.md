# nvc-tools

A gallery of small React components for NVC tools. The home page lists every
component; clicking one opens a page with controls for its props and a live
preview below. These components will later be assembled into an app and/or an
Obsidian plugin — for now the gallery is the only surface.

## Design rules

- **Low fidelity.** Minimal effort on making things look pretty — no colour or
  font work unless asked. Do use structural CSS (grid, table, flex, spacing) so
  the shape of a component is legible. Keep to one or two heading levels.
- **No UI library**, no CSS framework, no CSS-in-JS. Plain semantic HTML.
- Styles live in a **CSS Module** next to the component
  (`src/components/Foo.module.css`, imported as `styles`). Put a rule in
  `src/index.css` only when it is genuinely global across components.
- Components are **presentational only**: props in, JSX out. No state, no
  effects, no fetching, no globals, no awareness of routing. State belongs in
  the demo page (and later, in the app). The one exception is **transient
  animation state** — something that exists only for the length of a transition
  and that no host could ever read back. `FeelingPrompt` and `NeedPrompt` keep
  the card just answered so it has something to fly off with; putting that in a
  machine would make every host own a timer just to end an animation.
- **Flow state lives in a machine.** When a component walks someone through
  several steps, put the state in `src/machines/` as a pure module — a state
  type, an action type, `init`, `reduce`, and selectors, with no React import.
  The component takes `state` and `onAction` props; the demo page (later the
  app or an Obsidian modal) owns the `useState` that drives it. See
  `src/machines/feelingCategoryWalk.ts` and
  `src/components/FeelingCategoryWalk.tsx`.
- Type props with an explicit `type Props = { ... }`.
- **Terminology.** The domain noun is **feeling**, never *emotion* — that is what
  `src/data/feelings.ts` and the CNVC source call it. A **category** is a named
  group of feelings with a `kind` of `'met' | 'unmet'`; needs have categories
  too, but no `kind`. Name a component for the scope it covers: `*Picker` walks
  every category, `*Walk` walks one, `*Prompt` asks about one word, `*Card`
  just displays one thing. Prefer the singular (`NeedCategoryCard`, not
  `Needs…`) to match the data types.
- **Make impossible states unrepresentable.** Prefer a shape that cannot express
  a contradiction: a discriminated union over parallel optional fields, a
  required prop over an optional one with a silent fallback. Two caveats —
  redundancy is not contradiction (an unused fallback is fine), and a union buys
  nothing when the invalid case is a runtime property the type cannot see (an
  empty array, a blank string). Reach for it when the branches genuinely differ;
  otherwise just make the prop required.

## Adding a component

1. `src/components/Foo.tsx` — presentational, typed props, default export,
   plus `src/components/Foo.module.css` if it needs styles.
2. `src/demos/FooDemo.tsx` — one `useState` per prop, plain `<label>` controls,
   a `<hr />`, then `<Foo ... />`. A component with no options just renders
   itself and no controls.
3. Register it in the `demos` array in `src/demos/index.ts`.
4. `npm run dev`, then open `#/foo`.

## Layout

```
src/
  App.tsx            gallery shell: home list + demo page
  router.ts          useHashRoute() — hand-rolled, no router dependency
  index.css          global stylesheet, kept tiny
  components/        presentational components
  data/              NVC reference data (feelings, needs)
  demos/             one demo page per component, plus index.ts registry
  machines/          pure state machines (state + action + reduce, no React)
```

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server
- `npm run build` — typecheck (`tsc -b`) and build
- `npm run lint` — **oxlint**, not ESLint. Config is `.oxlintrc.json`.
